<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
The workshop has successfully engaged stakeholders in the Thai gemstone and jewelry industry with more than 50 entrepreneurs attended. The event featured a walk-through session for users to adopt the Provenance Proof Blockchain traceability system,&nbsp;<strong style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">presented by Mr. Klemens Link, Head of Development at Provenance Proof and the G&uuml;belin Gem Lab, both companies are part of the House of G&uuml;belin. Provenance Proof, an initiative from the House of G&uuml;belin</strong>, creates services and technologies enabling and promoting more transparency to the entire gem and jewelry industry.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
The Provenance Proof Blockchain is one of these innovative technologies. The first blockchain for colored gemstones is a digital, tamper-proof logbook tracking the relevant data along the supply chain, from one owner to the next. It is open to any stakeholder of the gemstone and jewelry community who is ready to embrace transparency, and free of charge as costs are born by the G&uuml;belin family.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
The workshop is carried out under the project study entitled&nbsp;<strong style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">&quot;Study on Tracking and Traceability Framework for Coloured Gemstone&quot; by the Bolliger &amp; Company (Thailand) Ltd.</strong>&nbsp;one of the leading consulting company in Thailand. The main objective to develop the gem and jewelry industry for its supreme operability in the global market.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
This collaboration is an important stepping stone for Thai gem and jewelry industry as it will allow us to be in the frontline of technological disruption and have the concerns of Thai gem and jewelry industry adequately represented in the further development of Provenance Proof platform. The successful workshop hosted earlier last February paved the way to further cooperation between the GIT and Provenance Proof.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
